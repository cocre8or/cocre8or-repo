  <h2>What is numerology?</h2>
  <p>Numerology is the science of numbers. It is an ancient science that says numbers have vibration, thus quality. Figures on the otherhand have quantity.
    The roots of numerology and astrology can be traced back to ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks. The science of numbers is based on the concept that all is energy/vibration/frequency. This early form of astro-numerology is Chaldean or Vedic. There are differences between Chaldean and Pythagorean numerology; the birthday is more significant in Chaldean/Vedic numerology. 
    <br />The idea behind numerology is that <strong>Everything is numbers</strong> and has vibrational frequency. Understanding numerology will help us stay in <strong>flow</strong> with divinity.
  <br/><br/>
  They recognized the significance of numbers in various aspects of life, including mathematics, astronomy, and mysticism. Astrology was based on correlation of the stars/signs and the cycles, patterns, and seasons.
  In <strong>Chaldean numerology</strong>, the birth day is most significance, then the destiny numbers (aka life path numbers). The Chaldean method also examines
   the compound numbers, not just the reduced value. Additionally, the name you are most known by is more important than the birth name. 
   The Father of Mathematics and <strong>Modern Numerology</strong> is Pythagoras. He studied over 20+ years in Babylon & Egypt learning about math and science around 600 BC. The first source of numerology is truly unknown. Best known for
    the pythagorean theorem. a^2 + b^2 = c^2 for a right triangle. 
    <br />The idea behind numerology is that <strong>Everything is numbers</strong>. Understanding numerology will help us stay in <strong>flow</strong> with divinity.
  <br/><br/>
Pythagorean Influence: The Greek philosopher Pythagoras (c. 600 BC) is often credited with developing a formal system of numerology. He believed that numbers had inherent meanings and that they could be used to understand the universe. Pythagorean numerology assigns specific meanings to numbers 1 through 9 and the master numbers 11 and 22.
<br/><br/>
   The numbers themselves have the same meaning in both Pythagorean numerology and Chaldean, its the calculations that are different.
   For the name calculations I like to use Pythagorean but for birthday and lifepath I use Chaldean as it is more in-depth.
<br/><br/>Psalms 90: 12 - So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
  <br/><br/>Math is the universal language of the world and the cosmos.
