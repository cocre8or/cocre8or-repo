Its very important for those living out this vibration to find authentic ways to express their inner essence and be truly seen (behind the mask, and beyond the stage) and for many, this is the real challenge. Some threes stray from their path, giving up their dreams and talents and some even escape into drug abuse or promiscuity in a bid to silence their inner calling.

Their resourceful nature means that they are able to create something out of nothing and are often called upon in a crisis! However, self-sacrificing fours often demand too much both of themselves and others and can develop reputations as martyrs or tyrants: Their will-power and tenacity being misinterpreted as greed and stubbornness.

Many people living out this vibration are deeply intelligent, philosophical and spiritually-minded, as well as being great communicators that make excellent social anthropologists, archaeologists, teachers, writers, and historians. However, Number 5s can tend towards being self-absorbed and unaware of the more widespread effects of their footloose and seemingly reckless actions. The avoidance of commitment of many fives can also prevent deep and loyal bonds forming between them and the people in their lives, so it is really important for these folk to find ways of experiencing freedom and variety, without running away from responsibility and hurting their families."

  <h2>What is numerology?</h2>
  <p>Numerology is the science of numbers. It is an ancient science that says numbers have vibration, thus quality. Figures on the otherhand have quantity.
    The roots of numerology and astrology can be traced back to ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks. The science of numbers is based on the concept that all is energy/vibration/frequency. This early form of astro-numerology is Chaldean or Vedic. There are differences between Chaldean and Pythagorean numerology; the birthday is more significant in Chaldean/Vedic numerology. 
    <br />The idea behind numerology is that <strong>Everything is numbers</strong> and has vibrational frequency. Understanding numerology will help us stay in <strong>flow</strong> with divinity.
  <br/><br/>
  They recognized the significance of numbers in various aspects of life, including mathematics, astronomy, and mysticism. Astrology was based on correlation of the stars/signs and the cycles, patterns, and seasons.
  In <strong>Chaldean numerology</strong>, the birth day is most significance, then the destiny numbers (aka life path numbers). The Chaldean method also examines
   the compound numbers, not just the reduced value. Additionally, the name you are most known by is more important than the birth name. 
<br/><br/>Psalms 90: 12 - So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
  <br/><br/>Math is the universal language of the world and the cosmos.
