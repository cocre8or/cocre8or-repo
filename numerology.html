  <h2>What is numerology?</h2>
  <p>Numerology is the science of numbers. It is an ancient science that says numbers have vibration, thus quality. Figures on the otherhand have quantity.
  The Father of Mathematics and <strong>Modern Numerology</strong> is Pythagoras. He studied over 20+ years in Babylon & Egypt learning about math and science around 600 BC. The first source of numerology is truly unknown. Best known for
    the pythagorean theorem. a^2 + b^2 = c^2 for a right triangle. 
    <br />The idea behind numerology is that <strong>Everything is numbers</strong>. Understanding numerology will help us stay in <strong>flow</strong> with divinity.
  <br/><br/>
Pythagorean Influence: The Greek philosopher Pythagoras (c. 600 BC) is often credited with developing a formal system of numerology. He believed that numbers had inherent meanings and that they could be used to understand the universe. Pythagorean numerology assigns specific meanings to numbers 1 through 9 and the master numbers 11 and 22.

<br/><br/>Psalms 90: 12 - So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
  <br/><br/>Math is the universal language of the world and the cosmos.

Their resourceful nature means that they are able to create something out of nothing and are often called upon in a crisis! However, self-sacrificing fours often demand too much both of themselves and others and can develop reputations as martyrs or tyrants: Their will-power and tenacity being misinterpreted as greed and stubbornness. This completely baffles the confused Number 4 whose intentions are usually to benefit the good of all, so it is important for those living through this vibration to regularly release some of their perfectionist tendencies and practice kindness and compassion for both themselves and others."

However, Number 5s can tend towards being self-absorbed and unaware of the more widespread effects of their footloose and seemingly reckless actions.
